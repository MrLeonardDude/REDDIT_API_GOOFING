## Just Some Goofing Around with the Reddit API

### Learning some boilerplate and parameter passing to learn more about the OAuth2.0 configs 


## Running the Project 

Assuming you already created an App in the reddit settings config - [link to the First Steps if you haven't done it already](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/OAuth2-Quick-Start-Example#first-steps)- all you need to do is install the packages from requirements.txt, save your credentials in an .env file so no baddies can take your secrets and run with python (I recommend using python3.6 just to be safe I guess).

 ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
 
 ```python3 -m main```

And there you go, have fun crawling!
